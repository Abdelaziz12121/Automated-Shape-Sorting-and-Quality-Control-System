# Automated-Shape-Sorting-and-Quality-Control-System
Designed and built an automated system that sorts and inspects objects using a conveyor, rotating table, ESP32-CAM, and IR sensors. Integrated mechanical design (CATIA, ANSYS), embedded control (Arduino), and machine vision (Edge Impulse) for real-time classification and sorting.
